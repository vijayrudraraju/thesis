	Abstract = {Abstract --- In this paper, we argue that there is the need for a comprehensive approach to the programming and managing sensor and actuator applications in enterprises. We then propose the design of such an architecture. It includes a network infrastructure model, an application programming model, a distributed runtime, and tools for complete lifecycle management of the network and the applications. Based on the current proof-of-concept implementation we also discuss a number of technical challenges. I.},
